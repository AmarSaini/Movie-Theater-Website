# Movie-Theater-Website
A website based off of HTML + CSS with java servlets as the back-end server (Apache Tomcat on Eclipse Web Tools Platform). Used sqlite for the database, and Node.js to run the website through a localhost without the need to foward ports. Also, the sqlite database file is included in this repository.
